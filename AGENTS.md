# AGENTS

This repo is a learning path. We will work in slow, methodical steps with brief prompts that explain what we are doing and why.

Working agreement:
- Ask before creating or editing files; propose small diffs first.
- Use standard tools: Docker, GitHub Actions, Trivy, kubectl, Helm.
- Never store or invent secrets; reference GitHub Secrets or external providers.
- Keep changes minimal, explicit, and reversible.
- Track progress with a short plan; exactly one step in progress at a time.
- Provide concise explanations to help learning along the way.

Full learning plan and guardrails live in README.md.
